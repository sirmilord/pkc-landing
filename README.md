Fast Landing Page for App Download Funnel

A separate project to replace visually outdated App Download pages inside download funnels. Another objective was to reduce the number of steps a potential user will take just to download the App faster in a more convenient way. This is not a WordPress, just a handy coded landing page to minimize load times and for easy scaling on a large number of domains/subdomains with different Invite Codes. This page was integrated into PKCUSA.com website (first project), so has the same design for seamless User Experience. Designed by Robert Kerr, coded by me.
